## v3.0.16

### New Features & Improvements

#### Billing reference improvements

You can now add and save any billing reference of your choice to shipments, making it easier to keep track of important details. Plus, you can assign default references to your senders based on a per billing account basis, saving you time on future shipments. We’ve also combined 'Account references' and 'Custom references' into a single, easy-to-use list, with a convenient dropdown to select pre-defined options or create your own custom references.

#### Consignee search improvements

You’ll now experience more accurate results when searching for consignees, ensuring you find exactly who you’re looking for with ease. We’ve also optimized the performance, so searches are faster and more responsive.

#### Shipment report improvements

You can now generate reports using custom date ranges, giving you more control over the data you need. Plus, you can easily filter your reports by parcel or freight divisions, helping you get the specific insights you want.
