## v3.3.0

### Simple Shipping Mode
We've added a new "Simple Shipping Mode" option to make the shipping process even more user-friendly for those who prefer a streamlined experience. This mode is designed for users who want to create shipments without being overwhelmed by advanced features and settings.

#### What's new?
 - Users can now choose between "Simple" and "Advanced" shipping modes in their preferences.
 - In "Simple" mode, only the most essential fields and options are shown, making it more straight-forward to create a shipment.
 - The default mode can be set for each user, so you always get the experience that fits your needs best.
 - All your previous advanced settings are still available if you switch back to "Advanced" mode.
#### Who is this for?
 - Ideal for new users, or anyone who prefers simplistic or minimal interfaces.
 - Organizations can set up new staff with fewer options to reduce training and avoid confusion.
