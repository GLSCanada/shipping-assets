## v3.2.0

### What's New: Google Address Autocomplete

**Improved Address Format**: We've updated our address format to a more structured civic number and street name format. This ensures better compatibility with international shipping and improves address accuracy.

**Automatic Address Updates**: Your existing addresses will be automatically updated to the new format. If any addresses can't be converted, you may need to update them manually.

**Faster, More Accurate Address Entry**: Going forward, you can use Googleâ€™s Address Autocomplete to quickly search and select your address, reducing entry errors and ensuring more accurate shipping details.
