## v3.0.18

### New Features & Improvements

#### Billing account linking

We've implemented the ability for you to link your existing billing accounts to your profile without the need to reach out to customer service.

To link a billing account, go to options, then billing account management and click the 'Link Billing Account' button to begin the process. You will receive a confirmation email to the email address associated with this billing account before the account appears on your profile.

#### Updating your email address

You can now update your email directly within Smart4 Shipping. Simply go to options, user management and click on the user you wish to update. The 'username' field is no longer locked and will allow you to supply a new email address.

Please note, this only applies to the primary user of your organization, secondary users do not support email addresses at this time.

#### Quick rate improvements

Quick rate now supports manually inputting a sending address for scenarios where you would like an estimate for an address you do not yet have saved as a sender on your profile. This should significantly reduce the time it takes to perform quick, one-off rate estimates.

We've also removed the mandatory status on the billing account field. When a billing account is not provided, generic rates will be displayed instead of your billing accounts negotiated rates. Please note, billing accounts are still required when performing rate estimate for Freight shipments.
